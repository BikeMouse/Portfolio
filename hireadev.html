							<p>Are you looking for a dev? Do you need a website built? Do not look further, I can do that for you!</p>
							<p>I have developed in HTML5, Cascading Style Sheets and JavaScript. Additionally to the frontend technologies, I can also offer knowledge in backend techonolgies like Node.js, Express, MongoDB and React. There are a couple of my past projects linked, so I would encourage you to have a look at them. They are excellent examples of my capabilities. </p>
							<p>The process I am going through is transparent: I will be sitting down with you and discuss the needs you and your business have. After this discussion I will be asking for your budget, so I can confirm to you what I can do in the monetary frame you have - so please let me know during the inital talk where your priorities are. Lastly I will forward a contract to you with every detail we discussed and payment terms for you to be signed.</p>
							<p>If I have raised your interest, please leave me a message and I will be in touch with you!</p>
