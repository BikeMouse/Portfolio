							<p>Hi, I'm Judith, a full stack engineer located in Edinburgh, Scotland. 
								As far back as I can remember, I have always been surrounded by tech-savvy people in my social environment;  be it programmers, graphic designers or other IT people. Naturally, because of their influence, I too am tech-savvy. In my previous business administration roles I was the go-to person when colleagues needed help understanding their applications.
								I presently work in the hospitality sector with a high-tech delivery service that has implemented a trackable just-in-time methodology.
								The experience working with all the apps that I have made have led me to looking for more creative opportunities to build and develop my own products as a part of a team.</p>
							<p>The range of technologies I have used are Html 5, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), JavaScript on the frontend - with Web Accessibility in mind. On the backend I have used Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React and working with Object Oriented Programming methodology.</p>
